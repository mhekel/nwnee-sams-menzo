 # Notes

# The folder "Spaghetti-scripts is the mass collection of scripts - old and new that are for updating/editiing/chopping. 

Script naming info: --script in this list have been written by this mod's dm's/builders and meant to stay - however, improving any scripts 
is welcomed - and if rewritten/renamed please take note of where called from and adjust accordingly,. 

> ## Best/favored practice
All custom/updated/rewrites of scripts (excluding _inc and mod scripts) should follow the NWNWEE overhaul projects' style guide and traditional
naming as follows (the top names on the list are scrtipts by this mod's team)

| prefix | type | script name | prefix author |
| -----  | ---  | ----------  | -----------   |
| ely_  | any |                  DM Elysium
| zam_  | any |                   Zam's
| fub_  | any |                   DM Fubar
| sam_  | any |                   Sam's (original) - to be updated.
